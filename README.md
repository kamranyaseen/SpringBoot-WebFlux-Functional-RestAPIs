# SpringBoot WebFlux Functional RestAPIs

Reactive programming is about non-blocking applications. And Spring Framework 5 includes a new spring-webflux module, supports Reactive Streams for communicating backpressure across async components and libraries.

Spring WebFlux
Spring Framework 5.0 supports WebFlux with fully asynchronous and non-blocking and does NOT require the Servlet API(Unlike Spring MVC).

Spring WebFlux supports 2 distinct programming models:

– Annotation-based with @Controller

– Functional with Java 8 lambda style
